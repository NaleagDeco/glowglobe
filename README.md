GlowGlobe
------------

This is eventually going to be a program to be used in the conjunction with this [PiGlow](http://shop.pimoroni.com/products/piglow)/[Ikea Globe](http://pi.gadgetoid.com/article/making-a-piglow-remote) hack.

My goal is to come up with some kind of pleasing sequence/scheme for this idea, so it could actually be used for some kind of psychedelic moodpiece.

[Glow Globes](http://dune.wikia.com/wiki/Glowglobe) were mentioned as a standard illumination device in Frank Herbert's Dune, so that's where the name came from.
